# Vitaprint extrusion linearisation

This repository contains algorithm files and documentation for extrusion linearisation using the Vitaprint platform with piston drive extruders (syringe extrusion). Additional details of set-up, use and performance have been published in the research article [Algorithmic linearization improves Syringe-based extrusion in elastic systems using Hydrogel-based materials](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2023.111884), published in the Journal Materials & Design.
